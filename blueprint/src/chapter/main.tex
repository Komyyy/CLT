This document is a blueprint for the formalization of the central limit theorem in Lean.
For the proof, we will introduce and use characteristic functions, as well as the notion of tightness of sets of measures.

The main references for the results detailed here are
\begin{itemize}
	\item chapter 6 of Foundations of Modern Probability (3rd ed.), by Olav Kallenberg,
	\item chapter 8 of Measure Theory, volume II, by V. Bogachev.
